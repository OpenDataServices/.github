# Contributing

Open Data Services welcomes contributions to all of its software projects.

* We're interested in user experience and feedback from using the application.
* We'd like people to fix bugs and contribute to features.
* We're interested in people using the code for their own purposes.
* We're interested in suggestions, modifications and improvements.

All our code can be found at https://github.com/opendataservices

Projects should preferentially have a separate `CONTRIBUTING.md` file that gives specific information about how to contribute to that particular project. If not, GitHub will fall back to this generic `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the `.github` repository.

Everything we are working on, or considering, is kept in GitHub issues.

## How to report a bug or request a feature

If you are able to work with GitHub then please "Create an issue"

Before creating a new issue check to see if the issue already exists. If not, then please do report it. If you have permissions to assign the issue to people and milestones then try to select suitable options. 

If you are not comfortable working with GitHub, but would still like to contribute, then talk to us.  Details at: https://github.com/opendataservices

## Submitting changes

* Fork this repository (if you haven't previously)
* Make sure you're working on top of an up to date copy of the master branch
    - Create a branch named after the work you're doing (if you're targeting a specific issue, start the branch name with the issue number e.g. ``42-feature-name``)
* Do your work
    - If your work addresses a specific issue, reference that issue in your commit message by starting the commit message with ``[#issue number]`` e.g. ``[#64]``
    - If you are working on a library, there should be a `CHANGELOG.md` in the repository, update this. Ideally this should be in the same commit that you do the work in (to help commit level debugging later).
* Create a pull request
